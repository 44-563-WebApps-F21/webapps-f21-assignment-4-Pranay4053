<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p class="speech">What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little!</p>

<h6 class="name LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD. </h6>  <p class="speech">Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p class="speech">MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON. </h6> <p class="speech">My dear!

MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON"> LADY HUNSTANTON. </h6> <p class="speech"> Worn to shadows, dear? </p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6>  <p class="speech">Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD. </h6>  <p class="speech">It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
power and use it.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE"> LADY CAROLINE. </h6> <p class="stage-direction">[_Takes coffee from Servant_.] </p> <p class="speech"> What stuff and nonsense
all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
place.</p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p class="speech">But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline? </p>

<h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE"> LADY CAROLINE. </h6> <p class="speech"> Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby. </p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Takes coffee from Servant_.] </p> <p class="speech">Really?  And if they’re
not married?</p>

<h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class="speech"> If they are not married, they should be looking after a
wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
within twelve months.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD. </h6> <p class="stage-direction">[_Refuses coffee_.] </p> <p class="speech">But if they’re in love with some
one who, perhaps, is tied to another?</p>

<h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE"> LADY CAROLINE. </h6> <p class="speech"> In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
meddle with other people’s property.</p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p class="speech"> I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
people’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the
only true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we
don’t belong to any one.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD. </h6>  <p class="speech">Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON"> LADY HUNSTANTON. </h6> <p class="speech"> But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
legislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,
all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like
married men.</p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6>  <p class="speech">I certainly never know one from the other.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYSTUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD. </h6> <p class="speech"> Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man
has home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad
expression in the eyes of so many married men.</p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p class="speech"> Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they
are not.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON"> LADY HUNSTANTON. </h6>  <p class="speech">Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely
changed since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear
Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.</p>

<h6 class="name ALLONBY"> MRS. ALLONBY. </h6> <p class="speech">Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of
meeting him.</p>
